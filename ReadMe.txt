I started a new solution and project as a asp .net web application for this exercise.
Please run wwwroot\index.html to see the ng-grid.
I added codes to check for datatype formatting in models folder.
The grid is populated from the data and not from the C# function. I worked with Angularjs 2.0 2 years ago and as I remember 
I had to use Jquery to call the webapi in C#. I'm not sure what the syntax for calling the function now with the new angular js.

For a scalable enterprise solution for this exercise:
- use entity framework to map it to a table in sql server
- use APIweb calls to do the C.R.U.D (create, read, update and delete) on data row.
- use APIweb calls instead of functions due to the asynchronous nature 

Thanks
